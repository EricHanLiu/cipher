# Cipher

The encryption algorithm relies on a random number generator and an integer key to encrypt, and this same key to decrypt. Definitely not the most sophisticated cipher, just something I wrote for fun.
## How to use?
Download the .py file and __run it__ (updated code to python3 compatibility).

#### Encrypting
1. Enter any phrase you want and a random key that you'll remember.
2. Save the encrypted text that is produced.

\***Note:** the phrase can only contain characters and spaces, and the key must be an integer.

#### Decrypting
1. Enter the encrypted text that you want to decypher.
2. Enter your key.
3. **Tada!**
