# Cipher

Decided to try my hand at making a fun little cipher.

Unfortunately the actually encryption algorithm that I wrote is absolutely terrible and very easy to decipher even without the script but hey it's my first one!

## How to use?
Download the .py file and __run it__.
####Encrypting
1. Enter any phrase you want\* and a random key that you'll remember.
2. Save the encrypted text that is produced.
####Decrypting
1. Enter the encrypted text that you want to decypher.
2. Enter your key.
3. Tada!
